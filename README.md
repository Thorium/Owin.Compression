# Owin.Compression

Compression (Deflate / GZip) module for Microsoft OWIN Selfhost filesystem pipeline.

With this module you can compress, deflate / gzip large files (like concatenated *.js or *.css files) to reduce amount of web traffic.

This project works on C# and F# and should work on Windows and Mono as well.


Here is a demo in action from Fiddler net traffic monitor:
